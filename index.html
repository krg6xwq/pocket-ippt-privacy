        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Pocket IPPT &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last updated: February 2026</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Pocket IPPT ("we", "our", or "the app") handles
            your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent
            about what data we collect and why.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect only what is necessary to provide the app's features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account information</strong> – If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your email
                address and a unique user ID from the authentication provider. If you continue as a guest, no personal
                identifiers are collected.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile data</strong> – Age, gender, and whether you are a CDG (Commando, Diver, or Guards) unit
                member. This is used solely to calculate your IPPT scores accurately.</li>
            <li><strong>Fitness data</strong> – Your IPPT station results (push-up reps, sit-up reps, 2.4km run time)
                and calculated scores. This data is stored so you can track your progress over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal data</strong> – Your selected IPPT goal and target deadline date.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect location data, contacts, browsing history, or any data unrelated to IPPT tracking.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To calculate and display your IPPT scores and award levels.</li>
            <li>To sync your results across devices when you are signed in.</li>
            <li>To display your progress history and goal tracking within the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any purpose beyond providing the app's core
            functionality.</p>

        <h2>3. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is stored securely in <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Firestore), a cloud
            database service. Data is linked to your account and accessible only to you. Firebase
            stores data in secure, encrypted servers. You can review Google's data practices at
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy"
                target="_blank">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            When you sign in with Google or Apple, authentication is handled entirely by those
            providers. We receive only your email address and a unique user identifier. We do not
            receive your password or payment information. Please refer to the respective privacy
            policies of these providers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any third parties, except as
            required to operate the app (i.e. Firebase for data storage and Google/Apple for
            authentication).
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            Your data is retained as long as your account exists. You can delete individual IPPT
            results from within the app. To request complete deletion of all your data, please
            contact us at the email address below and we will remove your account and associated
            data from our systems within 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Pocket IPPT is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
            collect personal information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
            by an updated date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes
            constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
        </p>
